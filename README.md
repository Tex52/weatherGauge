# Weather Gauge
## Based on IBM's Weather Underground API
In May of 2019 this app was created from the orginal nuts and volts gauge app.  This was to address the changs IBM made to the the old weather underground API.  Please note you must have a weather station uploading information to access IBM's API. 

This app has changed a great deal no longer supporting a web interface for configuration.  The data access has been rewrittena and it now uses bluetooth for configuration.
